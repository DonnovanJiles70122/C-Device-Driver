# CSC415-Device-Driver
**Background**:

The Linux operating system consists of the Kernel some other minor components and then a large number of Device Drivers.  Device drivers are the key to how various hardware devices interface with the computer.

**Task**:

Develop a skeleton device driver that can be loaded and run in Linux.  Then add some minor functionality to the device driver such as the user/application passing in a value to the device driver and the device driver returns that nth word from a file.  Include a document on how to build, load and interact with the device driver along with screen shots of output.
